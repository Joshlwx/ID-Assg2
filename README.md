For this project, I am doing a google map api which consist of the maps over the world and I included options for user to choose which directional method that the user prefer and also track user's current real-time location to navigate their surroundings.

# Design Process

This website is mainly on focusing for people that are interested on looking for directions to their destination with the estimated timeline for their journey. Based on my project, I can helped them on understang their journey method, duration of the journey and multiple directions that cater to the user's  preference.

As a users type, I want my users to first know which location they want to find out about from point A to point B. Next, user can choose which direction method they prefer and estimate how long will the journey took.

# Features

I would like to talk about my Homepage. It consist a big screen of an google map for user to navigate around. There are also point A and point B to let user know that they can input their starting place and destination. After user inputted their starting place and destination, there will be navigation option for user to choose either traffic, driving, walking, or cycling with the estimated real-time. Next, there is also a zoom-in and out function for the user to have a better and clearer vision to look at the map. Also, there is a rotational method either clockwise or anti-clockwise direction for user to have a better sense on going to their destination. Lastly, the last function is tracking that is able to track user's real-time location on where they are at now. 


# Testing

During my test, i encountered problems like the map, funtions is prompting out errors. location features and rotational is not working. I realised that I did not copied the Access Token of the google map api which did not appear in my webpage and for the other features like tracking and rotational did not appear in the webpage is due to some of the codings that I did not input. When the google map has succesfully appeared in my webpage, but it is too small so I enlarge it to full screen for the user to see and navigate it properly.
